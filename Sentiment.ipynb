The entire team are very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful.

Anita told me there would be no complications in removing my wisdom teeth and she indeed did remove them in March 2016 which went very smooth, quick and painless, not to mention she saved me a whole bunch of money by having the teeth removed by her team instead of a oral surgeon which I could put towards other procedures. Since then I have been loyal to her dental office and had multiple cleanings and various dental work, each time I cannot recommend this dentistry enough! The entire team are wonderful, pleasant and lovely. Any time a friend or work colleague asks for a dental recommendation, this is always the place I will tell them to go to. If you're looking for a new dentist give Red Tree Dental a try, I promise that your experience will be genuine and friendly! 5/5.\""
